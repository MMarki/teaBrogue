# teaBrogue

teaBrogue is a 1.7.5 brogue mod that reintroduces allies, along with a host of 
other balance changes. Ally frequency has been nerfed from 1.7.4, some items and 
monsters have been rebalanced, and all applicable Web fixes have been applied. The
game plays like a mix of 1.7.4 and 1.7.5 - it's a little easier than 1.7.5 and a 
little harder than 1.7.4.
