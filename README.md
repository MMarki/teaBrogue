# teaBrogue

teaBrogue is a 1.7.5 brogue mod that reintroduces allies, along with a host of 
other minor balance changes. It's meant to be a small mod, more on the order of 
Brogue+ for 1.7.4 than something massive like gBrogue.

Ally frequency has been nerfed from 1.7.4, some items and monsters have been 
rebalanced, and all applicable web-brogue fixes have been applied. The game plays like 
a mix of 1.7.4 and 1.7.5 - it's a little easier than 1.7.5. I wanted to create something 
that respects the intricate systems and tactical play of brogue, but was a little less 
punishing. If web-fixed Brogue is a 8/10 on the difficulty scale, I'm shooting for a 7/10 here. 
It's a good place for beginners to start experimenting with Brogue and for experienced 
1.7.5 players who miss allies.
