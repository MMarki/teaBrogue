# teaBrogue

teaBrogue is a 1.7.5 brogue mod that reintroduces allies, along with a host of 
other minor balance changes. It's meant to be a small mod, more on the order of 
Brogue+ for 1.7.4 than something massive like gBrogue.

Ally frequency has been nerfed from 1.7.4, some items and monsters have been 
rebalanced, and all applicable Web fixes have been applied. The game plays like 
a mix of 1.7.4 and 1.7.5 - it's a little easier than 1.7.5. It's a good place for 
beginners to start experimenting with brogue's elegant systems and for experiences 
1.7.5 players who miss allies.
